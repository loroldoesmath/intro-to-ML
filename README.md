## Course Overview
The primary goal of TEDA 1036 is to provide a practical introduction to machine learning for students with minimal background in mathematics and statistics. The course emphasizes hands-on experience and intuitive understanding over theoretical derivations.

All notebooks in this repository were written and executed using **Google Colab**, making it easy for students to run the code without requiring complex software installations.

---

## Contents
- **Python Notebooks**: Step-by-step tutorials and exercises to guide you through key machine learning concepts and techniques.
- **Datasets**: All datasets required for the course are included in the repository for easy access.

## Sources
Sources and further readings for specific concepts are included at the end each notebook. 

This course is based off of _Introduction to Machine Learning_ by Muller and Guido.
